# **Objectives of each exercise and the name of the concept/lesson being learned**

## **My First Code Coach (Statements):**

Let's code for real!

The given program should output the text: "My first C++ Code Coach!".

But something is wrong.

Task: Complete the code to generate the required output.

## **Outputting a Quote (Program Structure):**

Let's code for real!

You need to create a program that outputs a quote by the creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup.

The quote is: "Proof by analogy is fraud."

Task: Complete the code to generate the required output.

## **Smiley Face (Variables):**

The given code declares a variable with a value that is a representation of a smiley face using the @ character.

Task: Complete the code to output the value of the variable and check out the result!

## **Contact Info (Data Types):**

The given code declares some variables, then outputs them.

However, the code is missing the data types of the variables.

Task: Complete the code by adding the corresponding data types of the variables, based on the values assigned to them.

*Do not change the values of the variables, as they are needed to match the required output.*

## **Painting a Wall (Math):**

You are painting a rectangular wall and need to calculate the area in order to buy the necessary amount of paint.

The variables length and height define the size of the wall.

Task: Calculate and output the area of the wall.

*Hint: The area of the wall is its length multiplied by the height.*

## **Shopping (Comments):**

A local electronics shop has a great deal for notebooks.

You want to buy as many notebooks as you can afford. For that, you need to calculate how many notebooks you can buy with the amount in your bank account and how much money will be left over.

The given code includes comments as instructions for two tasks you need to complete.

Follow the instructions to solve this code coach!

## **Taking Input (Taking Input):**

Now that we know how to take input from the user, we can make more interactive programs!

Let's change one of our previous examples, where we calculated the area of a wall, and use the length and height values as input.

Task: Complete the code to take the length and height values as input, then calculate and output the area by multiplying them.

## **Club Entrance (Conditionals):**

You are making an app to control the entrance to a club.

Only clients who are 16 or older are allowed to enter.

Task: Take the age of the client as input, then output "Welcome", in case it's greater or equal to 16, and "Not allowed", if it's not.

For example, if the user enters 28 as their age, the output should be "Welcome".

*Output the corresponding message exactly as mentioned above, with a capital starting letter.*

## **Coffee Machine (The switch statement):**

*PRACTICE EXERCISE*:
Coffee Machine
A coffee machine makes 4 types of coffee:

Espresso
Americano
Cappuccino
Latte

Task: Create a program that outputs the correct coffee type based on the user's choice.

The choice variable is taken from input and is a number that corresponds to the coffee type.

## **Playground Tickets (Multiple Conditions):**
You are making an app to control the entrance of a playground and output the ticket category based on the age of the customer.

There are 3 categories of tickets:

Free: Ages 0-3 get free tickets
Discounted: Ages 4-6 get discounted tickets.
Normal: Ages 7+ get a normal ticket.

Task: Take the age of the customer as input, then output the ticket category corresponding to that age.

For example, if the user enters 5 as the age, the output should be "Discounted".

## **Countdown (while Loops):**
Create a timer program that will take the number of seconds as input, and countdown to 0.

Here is a sample output for the input 5:

5
4
3
2
1
0

*Note that the output should also include the number 0 and have each number on a new line.*

## **Sum (for Loops):**

You need to create an app that calculates the sum of the numbers 1 to N, where N is taken from input.

For example, for the number 5, the output should be 15, because 1+2+3+4+5=15.
