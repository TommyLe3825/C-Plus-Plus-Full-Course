# **C++ Intermediate:**
**Objectives of each exercise and the name of the concept/lesson being learned**

## **Example of a class (classes/access specifiers)**
Complete the given program. Define a class Bird which has one public method called makeSound(). That prints "chirp-chirp" when called.
Expected Output: chirp-chirp

*Don't forget to add access specifier - the public keyword.*

## **Example of Encapsulation (Encapsulation)
You are a supercar engineer and currently setting the engine's horsepower.

Complete the given program by completing methods to set and get the horsepower of the car object in order to output it.

The program should warn "Too much" if the inputted horsepower is above 800.

Sample Input: 
950

Sample Output:

Too much

950

*You should use the if statement directly inside the setter function.*

## **The Ninth Wave (Constructors)**

The given program defines a Painting class and creates an object using the constructor.

Fix the code so that the constructor takes the name as the argument and outputs it.

Sample Input:

Ocean

Sample Output:

Ocean

*The constructor should take one string as the argument and output it.*

## **Queue Management (Part 1)**

You are working on a Queue management system and need to create the class to hold the queue data, which are customer IDs (integers).

You make a **Queue** class, which has a size attribute, and an array, to hold the data of the queue.

The class has a **remove()** method to remove the front item of the queue, a **print()** method to output the queue.

You need to create an **add()** method for the Queue class, that will take an item and add it to the end of the queue.

The code needs to be fully working, so that the Queue declaration and manipulation code in main() works.

*Do not forget to increment the size after adding the item to the array.*
*Read the code carefully, before making any changes.*

## **Player Destructor (Destructors)**

You are making a game. The given code declares a Player class with a points member.

You need to add the destructor to the Player class, which should print the remaining points when the program finishes execution.

*Remember, the destructor is defined using the ~ symbol.*

## **Charge! (Selection Operator)**
You are creating a program to manage smartphones. The given code declares a **Phone** class, with its constructor and two methods: **use()** and **getCharge()**.
A **Phone** object is declared in main. Complete the code to call the **getCharge()** method using the correct selection operator.

*You can call a member function directly on the object, or using the pointer.*

## **Creating Classes (Constant Objects)**
You are making a **Number** class to handle different math operations. The class includes an integer member and a **square()** method.

You need to complete the **square()** method so that the given code executes successfully. 

The **square()** method should return the square of **num**.

*Note, that the object is constant, so it can call only constant methods.*
